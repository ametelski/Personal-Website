    <p class="lead">I joined the Navy in January 2003 and after boot camp and training I was station on the USS Abraham Lincoln in Everett Washington. In my first two years I was an Airman (“a green shirt”), working on the flight deck launching and recovering aircraft. In my next two years I decided to change my position and become a Engineman Maintenance Technician. As an Engineman I was responsible for the operation and maintenance to four emergence diesel generates that could power the entire ship if was required. </p>
    <p class="lead">The Navy provided me many opportunities and experiences that has shaped me into the person that I am now, and I am very grateful that could serve my country. </p>
